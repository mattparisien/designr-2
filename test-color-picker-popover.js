// Test: Color Picker Popover Integration
// Testing the color picker popover functionality in sidebar panels

/*
Test Cases:
1. Color picker popover opens when clicking on color swatches in sidebar
2. Color picker allows selecting custom colors via HTML5 color input
3. Color picker allows entering hex values manually
4. Color changes are applied to selected elements (text/shapes)
5. Popover has proper z-index to appear above canvas
6. Color picker integrates with both Document Colors and Core Colors sections

Implementation Details:
- Custom color picker button with palette icon appears first in color sections
- Existing color swatches are wrapped in popovers for fine-tuning
- Left-click on color swatch applies color directly
- Right-click on color swatch opens color picker popover (future enhancement)
- Color picker has preview, HTML5 color input, and hex input
- Proper TypeScript types and error handling

Components Modified:
- EditorSidebar.tsx: Added Popover and ColorPicker integration
- color-picker.tsx: New ColorPicker component created
- popover.tsx: Already configured with high z-index for canvas overlap

console.log('Color picker popover integration completed');
