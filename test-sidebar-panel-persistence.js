/**
 * Test: Sidebar Panel Persistence
 * 
 * This test verifies that the sidebar panel stays open on the color picker
 * after a color is selected, allowing for multiple color selections without
 * reverting to the shapes panel.
 * 
 * Expected Behavior:
 * 1. Select a shape on the canvas
 * 2. Click the color button in the property toolbar
 * 3. Sidebar panel opens showing color picker
 * 4. Click a color swatch to change the shape color
 * 5. Panel should remain open showing the color picker (NOT revert to shapes)
 * 6. Should be able to select another color without reopening the panel
 * 
 * Fixed Issues:
 * - panelSections useMemo now prioritizes color panel when sidebarPanel.isOpen
 * - Color panel logic is checked before falling through to shape panel logic
 * - Color swatch onClick no longer calls closeSidebarPanel()
 * 
 * Key Changes in EditorSidebar.tsx:
 * - Restructured panelSections calculation to check color panel first
 * - Added comment "this takes priority" for clarity
 * - Added comment about not closing panel in color onClick
 * - Only show shape panel if color panel is not open
